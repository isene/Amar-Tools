    <td>This program will only make sense to you if you know what
    roleplaying games (RPGs) are. It is a usefull asset to the <a
    href="http://d6gaming.org">Amar RPG</a>. Upon pressing "Generate
    random encounter" or "Generate a detailed human NPC", you will be
    asked for certain inputs. You may select or enter values in any of the
    input fields. Those you don't will be randomly generated. When you
    have selected/entered the values you want, press "Submit", and the
    random encounter or detailed human NPC will be generated. If you are
    not happy with the result, but still want to keep those initial
    values, just press the button "Reload with same values". Happy
    generation :)
    <p>Several abbreviations are used. They are easily deciphered if you
    read the Amar RPG rules.  The more obscure ones are: Spell Heading:
    A?=Active/Passive? Here a "+" means both Active and passive.
    R?=Resist? AoE="Area Of Effect", and we have A=Animal, C=Creature,
    D=Demon, E=Elemental, O=Object, S=Spell, U=Undead, W=Weapon. The
    asterisk indicates that it will increase with the spell level. 1mr = 1
    meter radius.</p><br />
