	<td><p>The tools above will only make sense if you know what
    roleplaying games (RPGs) are. It is a usefull asset for players and
	Game Masters of the <a href="http://d6gaming.org">Amar RPG</a>.</p> 
	<p>Upon pressing the top three
	buttons, you will be asked for certain inputs. You may select or enter
	values in any of the input fields. Those you don't will be randomly
	generated. When you have selected/entered the values you want, press
	"Submit", and the random encounter or detailed human NPC will be
	generated. If you are not happy with the result, but still want to
	keep those initial values, just press the button "Reload with same
	values". When creating a random town, you will get a complete
	village/town/city populated with the right types of houses/shops and
	residents in each house. You will also get a graphical representation
	of the special relationships between the inhabitants. You can save
	your random town as a text file and edit it as you want. You can then
	upload your edited town to generate a new relationship map. The last
	two tools will give you random names for various races and 10 "Open
	Ended Dice Rolls".</p><br />
