	shows love or a strong alliance. A red line shows animosity while a
	double red line signifies deep hate. Both a black and a red line
	indicates a complex relationship. The residents that are not shown in
	the image does not have special relationships. Residents with the same
	surname has a good family relationship unless any lines shows an even
	better relationsip with black line(s) or bad relationsip with red
	line(s).</p>

	relations. If you are not satisfied with the generated relations,
	simply go back an upload the same file again.</p>
	<p> For large settlements, the map becomes chaotic, and then it is more 
	helpful to read the relations in a plain text file. To do so, simply 
	click the biutton "Download town relations". In the file, "+>"
	indicates a positive relationship, whereas "->" is a negative relationship.</small></p>
