THE BACKGROUND

Amar is a medieval fantasy kingdom. It is the only kingdom on an island. The kingdom is located in the south east quadrant of the island, bordering on the ocean to the south and to the west. To the north is a mountain range ruled by the dwarves. To the west is a large forest ruled by Trolls and the Araxi - a savage and chaotic dark human-like predator. A river separates the kingdom from this dangerous forest. Off the coast of the island is an impenetrable fog, a few nautical miles off the cost. Any escape to the east or south is futile - the fog will return any sailor to the point he entered it. The climate is temperate.
