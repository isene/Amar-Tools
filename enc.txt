THE WORLD OF AMAR

Amar is a medieval fantasy kingdom on an isolated island. The kingdom occupies the southeast quadrant, bordered by ocean to the south and east. To the north lies a mountain range ruled by dwarves. To the west, across a protective river, sprawls a dark forest inhabited by Trolls and the Araxi - savage, chaotic predators. An impenetrable fog surrounds the island waters, trapping all within by returning any ship to where it entered. The climate is temperate.
