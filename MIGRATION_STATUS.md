Original System (Preserved):
├── includes/
│   ├── class_npc.rb             # Original NPC class
│   └── tables/
│       └── chartype.rb          # Original templates
└── cli_npc_output.rb            # Original output

## Testing Results

✓ NPC generation working for all character types

✓ Mark progression system functional
✓ Modifier calculations correct (BP, DB, MD)
✓ Equipment compatibility maintained

## Known Issues

- Spell generation currently uses placeholder data
- Some character types may need balance adjustments
- Wiki update will be substantial task requiring careful editing
