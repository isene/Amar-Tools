THE KINGDOM OF AMAR - World Setting

GEOGRAPHY & ISOLATION:
Amar is a medieval fantasy kingdom occupying the southeast quadrant of an isolated island. The kingdom borders ocean to the south and east. To the north, a mountain range forms the dwarven realm. To the west, across a protective river, lies a dark forest controlled by Trolls and the Araxi - savage, predatory humanoids. An supernatural fog barrier surrounds the island waters, making escape impossible - any ship entering returns to its origin point.
